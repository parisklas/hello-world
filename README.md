## Definitions

### Branches 
Use branches to create a copy of the main. You can experiment with variations of the main code in various branches before deciding to merge & commit the changes to main. 
Developers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from main (production) branch. When the change is ready, they merge branch into main. 


### Commits
Commits are saved changes. Add a commit message to explain why a particular change was made. This enables you to capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you've done and why.
