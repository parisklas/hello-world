## Definitions

### Branches 
Use branches to create a copy of the main. You can experiment with variations of the main code in various branches before deciding to merge & commit the changes to main. 
Developers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from main (production) branch. When the change is ready, they merge branch into main. 


### Commits
Commits are saved changes. Add a commit message to explain why a particular change was made. This enables you to capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you've done and why. 


### Pull Requests
Pull requests propose changes to the code & requests someone to review and 'pull in' your changes to the branch. The pull request will show the differences (diffs) in terms of changes, additions, and subtractions. There is also an @mention function for specific approval in collaborative environments, as well as a suite of other collaborative options (to use later).
